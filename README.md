# The Lawful Continuum
*A universal relational field generating structure, motion, and form.*

## What this repository provides
- A **lawful geometric construction** from a single radius: circle → G₆ → medians → **G₁₂**.
- **Recordable, reproducible** demonstrations (open the HTML files locally in a browser).
- A discipline-neutral foundation intended to be extended into analytic, algebraic, computational, and perceptual domains.

## Running the demonstrations
- Open `src/lawful_lattice_animation.html` in any modern browser to watch the construction unfold; use the **Record** button to export a short video.
- Open `src/metatron_frame_interactive_demo.html` for a generative, auto-remixing frame demonstration.

> All visible elements arise from one invariant act (the radius) and lawful derivations; no arbitrary parameters are introduced.

## Derivation at a glance
1. **Circle (radius R)** and six compass steps produce a **regular hexagon (G₆)**.
2. **Medians** of equilateral cells (lawful construction) reveal a secondary lattice rotated by **30°** and scaled **√3⁄3**.
3. Superposing the primal and dual yields **G₁₂** — twelve evenly spaced directional families at 30° intervals: a complete planar directional grammar.

See `docs/derivation.md` for the step-by-step construction with notes.

## Universality and scope
This framework is discipline-neutral. It presents a **lawful continuum** from which multiple fields can be derived. Example directions (to be developed in separate documents):
- Analytic extensions (field behavior on the lattice)
- Computational extensions (lawful iteration and visibility)
- Algebraic extensions (structures emerging from the same invariants)
- Perceptual/epistemic extensions (seeability and sayability as operators)

## Contributing
This is an evolving open framework. Contributions are welcome where they preserve the lawful invariants of the system: **lawfulness, seeability, sayability, continuity, correctness**. Please open issues or PRs describing proposed additions or examples.
